# [aurelia-typescript-atom](https://github.com/cmichaelgraham/aurelia-typescript-atom)

An starter kit for working with the Aurelia TypeScript using the Atom IDE

## Overview

This library works with the [Aurelia](http://www.aurelia.io/) platform.

It contains a [folder](https://github.com/cmichaelgraham/aurelia-typescript-atom/blob/master/aurelia-dts) of Aurelia type definitions in each sample

## sample: skel-nav-ts

This sample shows: 

* Aurelia, 
* the Aurelia DTS (TypeScript Definition) files, 
* ESRI JavaScript API, 
* the Aurelia AMD Bundle, and 
* the dojo requirejs AMD module loader.

At present, only the `latest` version is working.
